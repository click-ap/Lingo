# Lingo

Lingo is an open source web conferencing system from BigBlueButton.

Lingo supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard controls), chat, and the screen. Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, multi-user whiteboard, and breakout rooms.

Presenters can record and playback content for later sharing with others.

We designed Lingo for online learning (though it can be used for many other applications). The educational use cases for Lingo are

- Online tutoring (one-to-one)
- Flipped classrooms (recording content ahead of your session)
- Group collaboration (many-to-many)
- Online classes (one-to-many)

You can install on a Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit server. We provide bbb-install.sh to let you have a server up and running within 30 minutes (or your money back :-).
